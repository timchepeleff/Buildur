Buildur was created for developers, exclusively. Build a profile, match up with other buildurs based on your preferences then build out your ideas together. It was created in hopes to make collaboration and networking easier within the software development field. Buildur leverages GitHub's API to provide developers with a dead simple access point that also provides a ton of dynamic information to populate their profile.

#### How it works.
After signing in with GitHub, you’ll start by filling out your profile. Finished and ready to find some kick-ass developers to collaborate with? Good.

When you click on “Discover”,  my algorithm calculates (based off of your preferences) the most likely matches and displays them on your screen; it’s simple, quick and fun. If you like what you see, send a pull request to add them as a friend.

If they decide to merge you in you’ll both be able to start a conversation using the built in chat feature. The whole point is to introduce you to other developers and build relationships based off of similar interests.

#### So, Why did I build it?
I wanted something that would immediatly give back to the community. Networking and building relationships is huge in this industry. I wanted to take some of the intimidation out of it and introduce the right people to each other based on what they were interested in.
