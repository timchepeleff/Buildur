Build a profile, match up with other buildurs' based on your preferences then build out your ideas, together.

Builur was built for developers, exclusively. It leverages GitHub's API to provide developers with a dead simple access point that also provides a ton of dynamic information to populate their profile.

After signing in you start by filling out your developer profile.

Finished and ready to find some kick-ass developers to collaborate with? Good.

The next step is automatic. When you click on "Discover" algorithm calculates(based off of your preferences) the most likely matches and displays them on your screen, in a simple format that is quick and fun. You see one developer's profile at a time, if you like what you see, go ahead and submit a pull request to add them as a friend. Maybe they’ll decide you’re merge worthy which will allow you both to start a conversation using the build in chat feature.

The whole point is to introduce you to other developers and build relationships based off of similar interests.

I've learned that the web development culture is fun and quirky. If you have an idea of something you want to build, there is probably someone out there who would love to build it with you. Typically the only problem is actually finding the right person.

Builder was built to provide a way for developers to meet other developers who are doing complimentary or contrasting work.

Software is developed for people, so shouldn't it be developed by a group people too? Collaboration is more fun anyways.
