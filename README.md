Buildur was created for developers, exclusively. Build a profile, match up with other buildurs based on your preferences then build out your ideas together. It leverages GitHub's API to provide developers with a dead simple access point that also provides a ton of dynamic information to populate their profile.

After signing in, you’ll start by filling out your profile. Finished and ready to find some kick-ass developers to collaborate with? Good.

When you click on “Discover”,  my algorithm calculates (based off of your preferences) the most likely matches and displays them on your screen; it’s simple, quick and fun. If you like what you see, send a pull request to add them as a friend. If they decide to merge you in you’ll both be able to start a conversation using the built in chat feature. The whole point is to introduce you to other developers and build relationships based off of similar interests.
